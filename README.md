# MBTA_Lite
 "MBTA_lite," is based as a proof of concept for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's (MBTA) Subway-Train system. Focused initially on implementing the 'Red,' 'Blue,' and 'Orange' lines due to their straightforward configurations before extending to the 'Green' and 'Ashmont-Mattapan' lines.
